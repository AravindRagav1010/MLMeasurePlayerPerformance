# MLMeasurePlayerPerformance
A Machine Learning Approach To Measuring Player Performance  
  
This project presents a data science approach to minimize the time taken in selecting a player for a team by considering the cost and playerâ€™s skills as constraints.
In this Project, we used various method of analysing perfomance of the model that includes AUC ROC classifier, while predicting the player using the model XGBoost.  
This analysis is then showcased pictorially with the help of graphs for better analysis and Visualization.
