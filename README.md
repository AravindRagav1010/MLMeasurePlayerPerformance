# MLMeasurePlayerPerformance
A Machine Learning Approach To Measuring Player Performance  
  
This project presents a data science approach to minimize the time taken in selecting a player for a team by considering the cost and the playerâ€™s skills as constraints.
In this Project, we used various methods of analyzing the performance of the model that includes the AUC ROC classifier, while predicting the player using the model XGBoost.  
This analysis is then showcased pictorially with the help of graphs for better analysis and Visualization.
